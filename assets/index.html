        <p> Hello my name is Jennifer Arevalo, welcome to my portfolio page, here I wanted to share some of the many skills I have. Such as my typography skills, photography, and graphic design. I have spent time studying each subject, in a collage setting and also in a real work life. Here is a collection of some of the different projects I have been a part of. This page also expresses some of my hobbies and passions, one of which being art which I have studied for many years. </p>
